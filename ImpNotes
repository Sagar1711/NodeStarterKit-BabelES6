1. when dealing with import statements remember they are a bit different than require and module.imports
2. any folder with index file is a module therefor the import path is == import <foldername in case default export is given otherwise specify what to import> form <pathToFolder>
require and export(ES6) are not compatible to have it both way
        for example a module should work with require as well as import statements use both
            export default router
            module.exports = router
